Peripheral drivers written for stm32f446xx ARM Cortex-M4 based processor

This repo is dedicated to peripheral drivers written for the stm32f446xx microcontrollers. 

I am programming these drivers myself to build my knowledge of the ARM cortex architecture, communication protocols and peripheral functionallity.

### Peripherals Completed
- [x] GPIO
- [x] SPI
- [x] I2C
- [x] UART/USART
- [x] SYSTCK (System Timer)
- [ ] Timers
- [x] ADC
- [x] DMA

### Driver Code
Navigate to ./Drivers to see the driver source code and header files for each peripheral.

### Test Code
Navigate to ./Src for the code used to test peripheral drivers.
